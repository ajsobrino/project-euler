## Problem Two

### Statement
  
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
<pre>	1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...  </pre>
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Resolve:**

I resolve this problem with basic algorithms, I have calculated the *Fibonacci sequence* and I have checked if the number was even-valued, in this case I have added the value to the total. This algoritmhs are inside a loop of type *while* that check if the sequence value is less than four million.
