## Problem Ten

### Statement

The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.
Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

**Resolve:**
I have used the code of previous problem where I had a algorithm for to find prime number. Hence I use this algorithms and check if number is prime, in this case I sum to the total result. I do this up to the number two million
