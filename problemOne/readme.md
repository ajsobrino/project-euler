## Problem one

### Statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

**Resolve:**

The solution is easy, I go through the number 1,2,...,1000 and check if the number is multiple of three or five, if this predicate is true sum the value.
