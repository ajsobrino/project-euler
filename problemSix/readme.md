## Problem Six

### Statement
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
<pre>	12+22+...+102=385</pre>
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
<pre>	(1+2+...+10)2=552=3025</pre>
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

**Resolve:**
This problem there are not algorithms, you only have to do the operation.
    $$\left( \sum_{i=1}^{100} i\right)^{2}-\sum_{i=1}^{100} i^{2}$$
